## Linked Read Platforms

### 10x Genomics Chromium / GemCode
10x Genomics linked-read technology comes in two versions; the older [GemCode (v1)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3432) and more recent [Chromium Genome (v2)]( https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.234443.118>). Long DNA fragments are combined in droplets with barcode-containing gel-beads to create GEMs ((Gel Bead-In EMulsions). The fragments are amplified and barcoded using a combination of free random hexamers and barcode-linked random hexamers from the gel beads. Following this barcoded fragments are recovered and fragments before ligation of 3' sequencing adaptor. Libraries are sequenced using Illumina Sequencing. The commercial version of the technology is [currently discontinued](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/linked-reads).

### TELL-Seq
TELL-seq is based on the technology from [Chen et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.260380.119) and is commercially available from the company [Universal Sequencing](https://www.universalsequencing.com/). The method uses clonaly barcode beads with attacted tagmentases to cut and barcode individual long DNA fragments in solution. A second tagmentation is also preformed in solution to introduce a second adaptor. The library is sequenced using Illumina sequencing with special setup to sequence the barcode as index 1.

### stLFR
stLFR (single-tube long fragment read) is based on the technology described in [Wang et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.245126.118) and is commercially available from [MGI](https://en.mgi-tech.com/products/reagents_info/18/). The technology uses tagmentation to individually cut-and-hold long DNA fragments in solution. The tagmentase-DNA complex is then hybridized and individually wrapped around barcoded beads through the adaptor introduced by the tagmentation. The barcode is then ligated to each subfragment before recovery and final library preparation. Sequencing is performed on the DNBSEQ platforms.

### DBS
Droplet Barcode Sequencing (DBS) is based on the technology described in [Redin el al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-54446-x). Long DNA fragments are subjected to tagmentation using Tn5-covered beads to cut, tag and wrap the fragment around the beads. The DNA-wrapped beads are then used in emmulsion PCR along with barcoded oligo. Within each emmulsion droplet the barcode and tagged fragments are amplified independently and then linked using overlap-extension. Barcode-linked fragments are recovered and indexed for Illumina sequencing.

### CPT-seq
Technologies based [Amini et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3119) and the follow-up CPTv2-seq from [Zhang et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3897). These technologies were developed by Illumina but are not commercially available.

### Haplotagging
Haplotagging is based on the technology presented in [Meier et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2015005118). The technology uses barcoded beads
covered with Tn5 tagmentase to cut and barcode individual long DNA fragments in solution. The beads are coated in a combination of two barcodes AB and CB
that become inserted at the 5' and 3' of each cut fragment. Barcodes are combinatorially generated with about 85 million possible combinations in total. 

### Constellation 
Constellation mapped reads is a soon-to-be-released product from Illumina, see [press release](https://www.illumina.com/company/news-center/press-releases/press-release-details.html?newsid=a8203e6f-0b9a-4aa6-9f5e-8037fc464e39). Unlike the other linked read technologies that rely on DNA barcodes to link fragments, constellation uses flowcell proximity to link together reads that originate from the same fragment. More info to come...
